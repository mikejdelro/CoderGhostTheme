# mikejdelro-Coder-Ghost
A fork of [www.mbejda.com](https://github.com/mbejda/CoderGhostTheme)'s [Coder Ghost Theme](https://github.com/mbejda/CoderGhostTheme) to suit my own needs.

- Removed the Google Analytics codeblock in `default.hbs`, use code injection for that instead
- Cleaned up tabs and spaces for readability
- Fixed the Navigation Bar to include the Navigation pane from Ghost
- Fixed Logo
- Pointed Attribution. Please create an attribution page (https://url.com/attribution) to point for your source work
- Added Creative Commons Licensing at the Bottom of the page
